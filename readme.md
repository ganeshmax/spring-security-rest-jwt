### Sample project using Spring Boot, Spring Security, Groovy, REST and JWT ###

This is a sample spring based web application for serving pure REST services. The idea behind this app is to demonstrate 
spring security authentication and authorization using a stateless JWT token 

We use a token based authentication mechanism using JWT. JWT enables us to re-authenticate the user on every request 
statelessly without storing the token itself on the server using a persistent store, cache or session.
